# Various Site Tweaks

Notes:
* Need dottweak add on installed for this to work in the browser.
* Need to use the `install_native.py` for add on to work.

All css needs to be processed with `add-important.js`. for this to work because
it's a user stylesheet. See this discussion [0]

* `yarn install` to populate node modules.
* `./add-important.js <file>.css` will print out the updated css
