" ###Leader Mappings###
" These two mappings set up the leader key. The <leader> mapping defaults to
" `\` but that key is hard to reach. I prefer to set it to `,`
" `mapleader` is used for global mappings and `maplocalleader` is used for
" buffer-local mappings. For example the pandoc plugin has a few buffer local
" mappings that make editing a pandoc document nicer.
"
" There can be some conflict with buffer local mappings and global mappings
" from plugins and what I define if I set `mapleader` and `maplocalleader` to
" be the same, but I prefer to deal with that when the problem arises.
"
" Note that these need to be defined here because all the plugins make use of
" the leader key

let mapleader = ","
let maplocalleader = ","

" ### Plugin Installation ###
" Vim plugin management is difficult at best so we use [Vundle][vu] to help us
" install and manage plugins.
"
" Vundle lets a very cool `Bundle` function become available. You can feed it
" a string in the form from `user/repo` and will get the appropriate github
" repo. Other strings could be a vim-script repo or a git url for a non github
" repo. The Vundle documentation has more information.
"
" I use Vundle over Pathogen because pathogen requires you to manage the
" plugins externally and it would fill my `.vim/` will all sorts of stuff that
" I did not write.
"
" [vu]: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
"
" These lines are required to set up vundle/
" This assumes we have vundle installed in `/.vim/bundle/vundle`
"

filetype off
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
call vundle#rc()
" This line lets Vundle manage itself. This is required. This will also ensure
" that when you run `BundleInstall!` to update your plugins it will also
" update vundle, which is very nice.
Bundle "gmarik/vundle"

" ####Solarized Colorscheme####
" [Solarized][sol] is the only good colorscheme ever. This also ensures I
" always have the latest version.
"
" [sol]: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
Bundle "altercation/vim-colors-solarized"
" Enables solarized
colorscheme solarized
" Use dark solarized
set background=dark

" ####Ack.vim####
" `ack` is better than `grep` and [Ack.vim][ack] brings integration to Vim. It
" acts as a replacement for Vim's `:grep` commands.
"
" [ack]: https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim
Bundle "mileszs/ack.vim"

" ####Vim-Pandoc####
" This [plugin][pdc-vim] is a bundle of tools for [Pandoc][pdc]'s extended markdown. It
" provides Pandoc and regular markdown syntax highlighting, folding and a few
" useful local-leader mappings. Weird behaviour tends to happen when installed
" with vim-markdown but this has most of that functionality.
